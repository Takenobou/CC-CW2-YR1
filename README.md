## Objectives
Overview: In this coursework, you will create a CV web page <userName.html> using HTML and Cascaded Style Sheets. You are free to design your own web page, but contend should cover some specific information and you are only allowed to use HTML and CSS.

What you need to do in this CW? 
You will implement a web page. You need to use at least 3 different text formats, coloured background, and hypertexts to link your page to related online documents. Your page should be styled by CSS. The 50pts of the CW Grade will be based on physical appearance of the HTML page. The remaining 50pts will be based on Strengths and Motivations.  Your page has to provide:
1)	Your picture 168px to 168px. 
2)	Your name, surname, and your course (Computer Science, Creative Computing, Software Engineering, etc.)
3)	A paragraph to describe your Strengths (25pts of the CW Grade): Identify and describe one of your strengths. Identify which of the types of assessment described on slide 11 in the first CO1101 lecture that this strength can be applied to and why. Provide evidence to show that you have this strength using specific examples e.g. from your studies, the workplace or your personal life. (150-200 words).
4)	A paragraph to describe your Motivations (25pts of the CW Grade): Identify and describe one thing that motivates you and explain why?
